# Interactive Form with React and CSS

This project is an interactive form built using React and styled with CSS. The form allows users to input their personal information, including their name, email address, and message. The form also includes validation to ensure that all required fields are filled out before submission.

The form is built using React components, including input fields, buttons, and labels. The styling is done using CSS, including hover effects and animations.

The form is fully responsive and optimized for all devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop. The form is designed to be easy to use and intuitive, with clear labels and instructions for each input field.

To use the form, simply fill out the required fields and click the "Submit" button. If any required fields are missing or invalid, an error message will be displayed. If all fields are valid, the form will be submitted and a success message will be displayed.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of React and CSS for creating interactive and engaging user interfaces.
